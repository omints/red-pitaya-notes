Short description
-----

The implementation of the SDR receiver is quite straightforward:

 - An antenna is connected to one of the high-impedance analog inputs.
 - The on-board ADC (125 MS/s sampling frequency, 14-bit resolution) digitizes the RF signal from the antenna.
 - The data coming from the ADC is processed by a in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) digital down-converter (DDC) running on the Red Pitaya's FPGA.
 - The I/Q data is transmitted via TCP to the SDR programs such as SDR# and HDSDR.

The tunable frequency range covers from 0 Hz to 50 MHz.

The I/Q data rate is configurable and four settings are available: 50, 100, 250 and 500 kSPS.

Digital down-converter
-----

The basic blocks of the digital down-converter (DDC) are shown on the following diagram:

The in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) demodulator is implemented using the [CORDIC algorithm](http://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/cordic.html). [CIC filter](http://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/cic_compiler.html) is used to decrease the data rate by a configurable factor within the range from 125 to 1250. [FIR filter](http://www.xilinx.com/products/intellectual-property/fir_compiler.html) compensates for the drop in the CIC frequency response, filters out high frequencies and reduces the data rate by a factor of two.

FIR filter coefficients are calculated with the following code in [R](http://www.r-project.org):
{% highlight R %}
library(signal)

# CIC filter parameters
R <- 125                       # Decimation factor
M <- 1                         # Differential delay
N <- 6                         # Number of stages

Fo <- 0.22                     # Pass band edge; 220 kHz

# fir2 parameters
k <- kaiserord(c(Fo, Fo+0.02), c(1, 0), 1/(2^16), 1)
L <- k$n                       # Filter order
Beta <- k$beta                 # Kaiser window parameter

# FIR filter design using fir2
s <- 0.001                     # Step size
fp <- seq(0.0, Fo, by=s)       # Pass band frequency samples
fs <- seq(Fo+0.02, 0.5, by=s)  # Stop band frequency samples
f <- c(fp, fs)*2               # Normalized frequency samples; 0<=f<=1

Mp <- matrix(1, 1, length(fp)) # Pass band response; Mp[1]=1
Mp[-1] <- abs(M*R*sin(pi*fp[-1]/R)/sin(pi*M*fp[-1]))^N
Mf <- c(Mp, matrix(0, 1, length(fs)))

h <- fir2(L, f, Mf, window=kaiser(L+1, Beta))

# Print filter coefficients
paste(as.character(h), collapse=", ")
{% endhighlight %}

To get an idea of the combined (CIC and FIR) filter response, the following figure shows a 256k FFT display from the SDR# program when Red Pitaya inputs are not connected to anything:

The [projects/sdr_receiver](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver) directory contains one Tcl file [block_design.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_receiver/block_design.tcl) that instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

The [projects/sdr_receiver/server](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver/server) directory contains the source code of the TCP server ([sdr-receiver.c](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_receiver/server/sdr-receiver.c)) that transmits the I/Q data stream (up to 2 x 32 bit x 500 kSPS = 30.5 Mbit/s) to the SDR programs and receives commands to configure the decimation rate and the frequency of the sine and cosine waves used for the I/Q demodulation.

User interface
-----

The I/Q data coming from Red Pitaya can be analyzed and processed by a SDR program such as [SDR#](http://sdrsharp.com/#download) or [HDSDR](http://www.hdsdr.de/).

The SDR programs are communicating with the SDR radio hardware through an External Input Output Dynamic Link Library (ExtIO-DLL). The detailed specifications of this interface and the source code examples can be found at the following links:

 - [Winrad - specifications for the external I/O DLL](http://www.winrad.org/bin/Winrad_Extio.pdf)
 - [HDSDR FAQ](http://www.hdsdr.de/faq.html)

Based on the [example ExtIO DLL](http://hdsdr.de/download/ExtIO/ExtIO_Demo_102.zip), I've developed a simple ExtIO plug-in for the Red Pitaya SDR receiver. The [projects/sdr_receiver/ExtIO_RedPitaya](https://github.com/pavel-demin/red-pitaya-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver/ExtIO_RedPitaya) directory contains the source code of this plug-in.

The ExtIO plug-in can be built from the source code with [Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279).

A pre-built ExtIO plug-in for the Red Pitaya SDR receiver can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5fy49wae6xwxa8a/AADBqDFBJpAnkcpAEARf5xQNa/sdr/ExtIO_RedPitaya.dll?dl=1).

For both SDR# and HDSDR, the `ExtIO_RedPitaya.dll` file should be copied to the directory where the program is installed and the program will recognize it automatically at start-up.

Antenna
-----

Inspired by the "Wideband active loop antenna" article appeared in the January, 2000 issue of Elektor Electronics, I've built my antenna using 4 wire telephone cable (9 m, 4 x 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup>). A schematic and picture of the antenna connected to Red Pitaya is shown in the following figure:

![Antenna schematic]({{ "/img/antenna-schematic.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) ![Antenna picture]({{ "/img/antenna-picture.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

With this antenna I can receive some MW and SW broadcast stations.
